		Since I'm not focusing on an artistic career, I wasn't inclined to create accounts on different
		websites to display my work. Either way, I like to build simple 3D scenes and regarding 2D art,
		I try some things, but nothing too fancy. Anyway, I really enjoy creating music - I started
		playing guitar when I was little, stopped after a while, and later started with a keyboard and
		banjo. I use Blender for my 3D art, FireAlpaca/Aseprite for 2D art, and FLStudio for my music.
		If you want to check out my art and music, you can play my games or watch my video uploads on my <a
