	<p style="text-align: justify;">
		Greetings! My name is Vinicius Rezende, but people call me Rezende! My interest in games started
		when I was a little boy - for countless hours, I used to play every title I grabbed. After a few
		years of trying to get a bachelor's degree in Archeology, I decided to change things up and
		start a new journey within the programming world. Time has passed, and now I'm a Game Developer
		- working as a game programmer.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">
		<b>TL;DR</b>: I am an indie game developer, working in the game industry as a game programmer.
