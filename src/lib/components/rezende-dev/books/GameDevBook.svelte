	<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
		As a game developer, I try to bring new and distinct ideas - for sure, a trial-and-error kind of
		process. I've worked with some frameworks and game engines, including Unity, Roblox Studio,
		Phaser, and Colyseus. Also, I have used many industry-standard libraries and plugins like FMOD.

	<p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
		My favorite framework is MonoGame. With it, I have access to a robust library and total control
		of my software architecture. My published games are under the name of <a

			Wise Shepherd Games
